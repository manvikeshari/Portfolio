        <h1>Hi, I am Manvi </h1>
        <h2>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a B.Tech student with a passion for technology and innovation.</h2>
        <p>I Currently a B.Tech student at United University, Prayagraj, I'm someone who loves to blend curiosity with
            code. From debugging tiny errors to dreaming up big ideas, my journey in tech has been all about learning,
            exploring, and evolving.

            I'm especially interested in how Artificial Intelligence and Data Science can solve real-world problems—and
            I'm diving deep into GenAI and LLMs to see just how far that curiosity can go. Whether I’m building web
            apps, exploring datasets, or just experimenting with new tech, I try to stay hands-on and open-minded.

            This portfolio is a little window into my world—my projects, passions, and the path I'm carving as I grow in
            both knowledge and creativity. Let’s connect, collaborate, and maybe even create something cool together!
